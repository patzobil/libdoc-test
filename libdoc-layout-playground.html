        <p  scroll-btween="test1"
            data-text-indent="|0 to -200|px">the canopy is the aboveground portion of a plant croping or crop, formed by the collection of individual plant crowns.</p>
        <p  scroll-btween="test2"
            data-text-indent="|-200 to 0|px">In forest ecology, canopy also refers to the upper layer or habitat zone, formed by mature tree crowns and including other biological organisms </p>
        <p  scroll-btween="test3"
            data-text-indent="|0 to -200|px">Sometimes the term canopy is used to refer to the extent of the outer layer of leaves of an individual tree or group of trees.</p>
        <p  scroll-btween="test4"
            data-text-indent="|-200 to 0|px">Shade trees normally have a dense canopy that blocks light from lower growing plants. </p>
        <p  scroll-btween="test5"
            data-text-indent="|0 to -200|px">Early observations of canopies were made from the ground using binoculars or by examining fallen material</p>
        <p  scroll-btween="test6"
            data-text-indent="|-200 to 0|px">Researchers would sometimes erroneously rely on extrapolation by using more reachable samples taken from the understory.</p>
        <p  scroll-btween="test1_2"
            data-text-indent="|0 to -200|px">In some cases, they would use unconventional methods such as chairs suspended on vines or hot-air dirigibles, among others.
        </p>
        <p  scroll-btween="test2_2"
            data-text-indent="|-200 to 0|px">Modern technology, including adapted mountaineering gear, has made canopy observation significantly easier and more accurate</p>
        <p  scroll-btween="test3_2"
            data-text-indent="|0 to -200|px">Canopy structure is the organization or spatial arrangement of a plant canopy.</p>
        <p  scroll-btween="test4_2"
            data-text-indent="|-200 to 0|px">The canopy is taller than the understory layer. The canopy holds 90% of the animals in the rainforest. </p>
        <p  scroll-btween="test5_2"
            data-text-indent="|0 to -200|px">They cover vast distances and appear to be unbroken when observed from an airplane. </p>
        <p  scroll-btween="test6_2"
            data-text-indent="|-200 to 0|px">However, despite overlapping tree branches, rainforest canopy trees rarely touch each other.</p>
